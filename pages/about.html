                    <p> After conducting over 150 interviews with refugees, we have learned that one 
                      of the biggest problems facing refugees as they are forced to leave their homes is the lack of money. 
                      Whatever liquid assets they have, refugees end up spending to secure food, transportation, and governement documents.
                      The rest of their assets get left behind, and looted by the perpetrators of violence. </p>
                  <p> But that's not the end of refugees' problems - asylum-granting countries often require asylum seekers to 
                      hand over a majority of their assets to pay for resettlement. (Source: New York Times, Danish Law Requires Asylum Seekers to Hand Over Valuables, January 16, 2016).

                  <h1> About Us </h1>
                      <p> We believe the world is ours to change. Our goal is to actually solve the problems facing communities in duress and enable refugees to live their lives with dignity.  </p>
                      <p> YouRefuge was started by a group of students at the Haas School of Business, at the University of California, Berkeley. These students were either refugees themselves, or had families impacted by war, genocide or discrimination.  </p>
                      <p> Key features we are prioritizing include a digital wallet, a buy-back feature, our profile portal,
                          and biometric identification.</p>
