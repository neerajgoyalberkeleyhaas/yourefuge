                    <h1> How You Can Help</h1>
                    <p> You can support a refugee by purchasing one of their valuables and providing them the much needed liquidity 
                        as they leave their homes. </p>
                    <p>
                        A refugee can choose to buy-back their assets for the exact price you paid, within a 
                        3-year period, if they so choose at the time of sale. In this case, YouRefuge
                        will pay the refugee immediately to help them for their journey, and YouRefuge will
                        hold the item for collateral. Within 1-3 years, the refugee will have to pay you buy-back
                        (based on their circumstances) to regain possession of the item, and your contribution will simply have 
                        been a loan to the refugee when they most needed it.
                    </p>
                    <p> If the Refugee does not enable the buy-back option and they just need the money immediately, your purchase
                        serves as a normal transaction and YouRefuge pays the refugee immediately, and delivers the item to you. 
                        You will have supported a person and her family in their most dire circumstance.
                    </p>
